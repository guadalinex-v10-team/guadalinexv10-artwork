# mdm Configuration file.
#
# This file should not be updated by hand.  Since mdm 2.13.0.4,
# configuration choices in the /etc/X11/mdm/mdm.conf-custom file will
# override the default values specified in this file (installation 
# locations of the configuration files may vary for different distros).
# This defaults.conf file may be overwritten on upgrade, so to ensure
# that your configuration choices are not lost, please make sure that 
# your changes are made only the the custom.conf file.
#
# If you were using an older version of mdm, your system may have the
# the older mdm.conf configuration file on the system.  If so, then this
# file is used instead of the custom.conf file for backwards support.
# If you make changes to the custom.conf file and they seem to not be
# taking effect, this is likely the problem.  Consider migrating your
# configuration to the new custom.conf file and removing the mdm.conf
# file.
#
# You can use the mdmsetup program to graphically edit the mdm.conf-custom
# file.  Note that mdmsetup does not support every option in this file, just
# the most common ones that users want to change.  If you feel that
# mdmsetup should support additional configuration options, please file a
# bug report at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.
#
# If you hand-edit the mdm configuration, you should run the following command
# to get the mdm daemon to recognize the change.  Any running mdm GUI programs
# will also be notified to update with the new configuration.
#
# mdmflexiserver --command="UPDATE_CONFIG <configuration key>"
#
# e.g, the "Enable" key in the "[debug]" section would be "debug/Enable".
#
# You can also run mdm-restart or mdm-safe-restart to cause mdm to restart and
# re-read the new configuration settings.  You can also restart mdm by sending
# a HUP or USR1 signal to the daemon.  HUP behaves like mdm-restart and causes
# any user session started by mdm to exit immediately while USR1 behaves like
# mdm-safe-restart and will wait until all users log out before restarting mdm.
